# Quick Audio Switcher
---

## Get BetterDiscord!

This plugin is designed for use with BetterDiscord. BetterDiscord is **required** in order to properly install and use this plugin. Get it here:

[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)

## Abstract

The Quick Audio Switcher plugin for BetterDiscord is intended for ease-of-use when it comes to switching your audio devices while using Discord. This need has been highlighted for users that stream frequently - using Discord as their voice platform - and the need arises to switch audio devices (headset dies, another local user on a different microphone needs to be heard, etc.). Instead of needing to weed your way through the Discord Settings page, and navigating to Voice & Video, and then changing your devices you can now change your audio input/output devices on the fly using mainscreen dropdown selections. Looking to integrate hotkeys soon so you won't even need to switch to Discord anymore! (One day...)

## Plugin Installation

1. If you haven't yet, download and install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
2. Download *audioswitch.plugin.js* from THIS GITHUB.
3. Copy *audioswitch.plugin.js* to your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
   > (I.E.: %appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins)
4. Exit and Relaunch Discord
5. Open **User Settings** *(cog next to your name in the bottom of the channel list)*
6. Locate the **BETTERDISCORD** menu category.
7. Open the **Plugins** menu.
8. Find the widget for **Quick Audio Switcher** by **4verage**.
9. Toggle the slider to the right to **ON**.

## Using the Plugin

Once you have enabled the **Quick Audio Switcher** plugin, you should now see two dropdown menus at the top of your Discord screen in the titlebar (next to the Minimize / Maximize / Close buttons). Each dropdown should be labeled **Input** and **Output**, respectively. Open the dropdown for either output or input to get a list of your devices attached to your system. You can then select one of the devices to dynamically change your Discord to utilize your selected device!

## Development Information

### Development Notes

This is my first iteration - and first plugin for BetterDiscord - of this plugin. This was to fill a need I had, and for my usage it is working so far. If anyone else decided to use it, and finds some things lacking or has improvement ideas, please let me know!

### Roadmap

- [ ] Customizable Hotkeys
- [ ] Update device lists on-the-fly
- [ ] Select other locations (or hide (after hotkeys are enabled)) for the dropdowns.
- [ ] Code optimization
